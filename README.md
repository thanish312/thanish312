# Thanish B Urs

Student who likes building things, breaking them, and learning from the process.

I build software that connects real-world workflows with distributed systems, with an emphasis on clarity, security, and usability over demos or hype.

## Featured Project: QubicLink

**QubicLink** is a Web3 identity verification and automation system that links on-chain wallet activity with Discord-based communities.

It enables secure role assignment, rewards, and engagement workflows by bridging blockchain signals with real community platforms — without requiring smart contract deployment.

**Key focus areas:**
- On-chain ↔ off-chain identity mapping  
- Automation of community roles and rewards  
- Practical integration with existing tools (Discord, no-code workflows)
